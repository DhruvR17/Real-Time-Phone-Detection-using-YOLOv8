# Real-Time-Phone-Detection-using-YOLOv8
This project demonstrates how to use Ultralytics YOLOv8 and OpenCV to perform real-time object detection through a webcam feed. The system identifies when a cell phone appears in the camera frame and visually highlights it with a bounding box and on-screen label.
